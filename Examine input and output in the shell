# Examine Input and Output in the Shell

In this lab, I used the `echo` command to understand how input is received and output is displayed in the Linux shell environment. I also explored other basic shell commands to get familiar with input/output operations and shell functionality.

Tasks completed:

- Generated output using the `echo` command  
- Performed basic calculations with the `expr` command  
- Cleared the shell window using the `clear` command  
- Explored additional shell commands to deepen understanding of input/output handling and shell behavior

This exercise helped improve my command-line skills and provided a foundation for working effectively in a Linux Bash shell.
