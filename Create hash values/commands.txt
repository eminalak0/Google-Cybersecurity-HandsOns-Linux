# Step 1: List contents of home directory to locate files
ls -l ~

# Step 2: View plain text content of the two files to compare manually
cat ~/file1.txt
cat ~/file2.txt

# Step 3: Compute SHA-256 hash for each file
sha256sum ~/file1.txt
sha256sum ~/file2.txt

# Step 4: Save the hashes to separate files
sha256sum ~/file1.txt > ~/hash1.txt
sha256sum ~/file2.txt > ~/hash2.txt

# Step 5: Compare the two hash files to check for differences
diff ~/hash1.txt ~/hash2.txt
