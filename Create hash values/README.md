# Create Hash Values

In this lab, I practiced generating cryptographic hash values using SHA-256 to verify file integrity. Hashing is a core skill in cybersecurity used for verifying data authenticity and detecting changes.

## Tasks Completed

- Listed the contents of the home directory to locate files  
- Compared the plain text contents of two files before hashing  
- Computed the SHA-256 hash values of both files using `sha256sum`  
- Compared the resulting hashes to identify differences and verify file integrity  

## Skills Gained

- Using Linux commands to navigate directories and view file contents  
- Generating SHA-256 hash values with `sha256sum`  
- Understanding how hashes can detect file changes or tampering  
- Strengthened foundational knowledge of cryptographic hashing important in cybersecurity

This lab helped me gain hands-on experience in creating and comparing hash values for file verification.
