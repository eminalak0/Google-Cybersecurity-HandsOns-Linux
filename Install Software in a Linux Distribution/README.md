# Install Software in a Linux Distribution

In this lab, I practiced using the `apt` package manager to install, uninstall, and manage software on a Debian-based Linux system. This hands-on activity introduced me to software package control â€” a foundational skill for any cybersecurity professional working in Linux environments.

## Tasks Completed

- Confirmed that `apt` is installed and accessible in the shell
- Installed **Suricata**, a network threat detection engine
- Uninstalled Suricata to observe dependency management
- Installed **tcpdump**, a packet analyzer
- Reinstalled Suricata to reinforce installation steps

## Skills Gained

- Proficiency with `apt` package manager
- Familiarity with installing/removing open-source security tools
- Improved comfort with command-line interfaces (CLI)

This experience gave me hands-on exposure to managing software tools critical in threat detection and traffic analysis.
