# Install Software in a Linux Distribution

In this hands-on project, I practiced installing, uninstalling, and managing software packages using the `apt` package manager on a Linux Bash environment.

Tasks completed:

- Verified `apt` is installed and working in Bash  
- Installed Suricata (an open-source network threat detection tool) using `apt`  
- Uninstalled Suricata  
- Installed `tcpdump` (a powerful command-line packet analyzer) with `apt`  
- Reinstalled Suricata

This exercise helped me build basic Linux command line skills and understand how to manage software packages on Debian-based systems.
