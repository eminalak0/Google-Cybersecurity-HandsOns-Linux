# Add and Manage Users with Linux Commands

In this hands-on lab, I practiced user and group management in a Linux system, which is fundamental for maintaining secure access control and proper user privileges. These skills are essential for system administrators and cybersecurity professionals to control who can access and modify system resources.

## Tasks Completed

- Added a new user (employee) to the system using `useradd`  
- Changed ownership of files with `chown` to assign proper access  
- Created a new group and added the user to it using `groupadd` and `usermod`  
- Deleted the user from the system with `userdel`  

## Skills Gained

- Hands-on experience with user account lifecycle management  
- Understanding of Linux file ownership and group permissions  
- Ability to control user privileges through group memberships  
- Familiarity with commands critical for managing system security and access

This lab prepared me to manage Linux system users effectively, a key task for enforcing security policies and access controls.
