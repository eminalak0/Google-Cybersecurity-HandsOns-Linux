# Examine Input and Output in the Shell

This hands-on lab focused on working with standard input and output in the Linux shell using basic terminal commands. It helped reinforce how the shell receives input and returns output, as well as how to interact with the system in a meaningful way.

## Tasks Completed

- Used the `echo` command to print text to the screen
- Performed basic arithmetic using the `expr` command
- Cleared the shell window using the `clear` command
- Explored additional commands to understand shell behavior

## Skills Gained

- Confidence with shell interaction and system feedback
- Understanding of basic text-based commands and output formatting
- Preparedness for deeper shell scripting and automation

This lab helped build my comfort in using the Bash environment for basic system communication and interaction.
