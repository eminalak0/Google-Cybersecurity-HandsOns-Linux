# Decrypt an Encrypted Message

In this lab, I practiced using Linux commands and classical cryptography techniques to decrypt messages and recover original files. These skills are fundamental in cybersecurity for analyzing encrypted data and performing forensic investigations.

## Tasks Completed

- Listed directory contents to locate encrypted files  
- Read file contents using Linux commands like `cat` and `less`  
- Applied classical cipher techniques to decrypt messages back to plaintext  
- Decrypted encrypted files and restored them to their original state using appropriate tools  

## Skills Gained

- Navigating file systems and handling files in Linux  
- Understanding and reversing classical encryption methods  
- Using command-line tools for cryptographic analysis  
- Strengthened ability to perform basic cryptanalysis and file recovery

This lab enhanced my practical skills in dealing with encrypted data, an important aspect of cybersecurity investigations.
