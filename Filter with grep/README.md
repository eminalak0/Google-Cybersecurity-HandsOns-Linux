# Filter with grep

In this hands-on lab, I learned to use the `grep` command to search for specific patterns and strings within files. This exercise is an essential part of working with log files and text processing in Linux â€” a core skill in cybersecurity for tasks such as identifying suspicious entries, parsing logs, and extracting key information.

## Objectives

- Learn how to search through files using the `grep` command
- Identify error messages or specific patterns in text-based files
- Practice locating user-related data through filtered search

## Tasks Completed

- **Searched for error messages in a file** using `grep "error" filename.log`  
- **Located files containing a specific string** using `grep -rl "keyword" /directory`  
- **Extracted user-related information** by searching through system/user files with tailored `grep` filters

## Skills Gained

- Efficient log filtering and pattern matching using `grep`  
- Improved ability to work with system logs and data files  
- Strengthened understanding of how text-based tools support real-world threat detection and auditing tasks

This experience is directly applicable to incident response, system monitoring, and log analysis workflows in cybersecurity operations.
