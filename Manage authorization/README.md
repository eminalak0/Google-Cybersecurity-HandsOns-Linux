# Manage Authorization (Linux File Permissions)

In this hands-on lab, I worked with file and directory permissions in a Linux environment to understand how access is granted, restricted, and managed at the system level. This experience is vital for anyone working in system hardening, incident response, or file access auditing.

## Tasks Completed

- Checked file and directory permissions using `ls -l`
- Identified files with incorrect or overly permissive access settings
- Changed permissions using `chmod` to enforce least privilege
- Used `chown` to modify file ownership when necessary
- Removed unauthorized access by adjusting directory permissions

## Skills Gained

- Ability to interpret Linux file permissions (rwx, user/group/others)
- Practical experience using `chmod`, `chown`, and `ls -l`
- Knowledge of how to restrict or grant access to sensitive files
- Strengthened understanding of system security at the file level

This lab reinforced my ability to manage access control on Linux systems â€” a key part of preventing unauthorized access and maintaining secure environments.
