# Get Help in the Command Line

In this hands-on lab, I explored built-in Linux commands that provide documentation and help directly from the terminal. These tools are essential for learning and troubleshooting in Linux environments, enabling efficient use of commands without needing external resources.

## Tasks Completed

- Used `man` to read detailed manuals for commands and options  
- Used `whatis` to get brief descriptions of commands  
- Used `apropos` to search for commands related to a keyword or task  
- Compared similar commands to understand their differences  
- Identified commands needed for common system tasks, such as creating a new group

## Skills Gained

- Familiarity with Linux manual pages and help systems  
- Ability to quickly find command syntax and usage information  
- Improved troubleshooting skills using native Linux resources  
- Enhanced ability to self-learn and explore Linux command options

This lab strengthened my ability to independently find solutions and understand command-line tools, a vital skill for cybersecurity and system administration roles.
