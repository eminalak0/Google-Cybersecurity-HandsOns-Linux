# Find Files with Linux Commands

As part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program, I completed a hands-on lab focused on navigating the Linux file system using shell commands. This lab helped reinforce key concepts related to file system structure, command-line navigation, and file content inspection.

## Objectives

- Learn how to find the current working directory
- List files and directories
- Navigate through the file system
- View file contents using standard Linux commands

## Tasks Completed

- **Checked current working directory** using `pwd` to understand where I am in the filesystem.
- **Listed directory contents** using `ls` and `ls -l` to view files and subfolders with details.
- **Navigated between directories** with `cd`, practicing moving deeper into nested folders.
- **Displayed contents of files** using `cat` to read full file content directly in the shell.
- **Viewed partial file content** using `head` to see the first 10 lines of a file.

## Skills Gained

- Improved command-line fluency in a Bash environment  
- Developed familiarity with essential Linux navigation and file commands  
- Understood how to locate and inspect files in a structured Linux system

This foundational experience will support future tasks involving log analysis, configuration audits, and scripting within cybersecurity workflows.
